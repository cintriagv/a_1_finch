hey Tyler,

below is a link to my github repository for the app in this technical assessment

full transparency: it's not all there yet - the async nature of node-fetch (a nodejs module im using for server side network calls) is tripping me up in saving the values i am pulling from the Finch API - while i am able to call the Finch API from my application; i cannot yet surface Finch data to the client

i will ensure this is set by the time we have our call next week though, so you will see updates made to the github repository linked below

the readme.txt of the github has guidance on how to run my application locally, as well as the dependensies used in this project; but i have also hosted some content files to make the redirect experience smoother since the Finch Dashboard requires an "https" redirect, and i cannot point to some "file:///" location

hope you had a good break and if you have any questions in the meantime, just let me know; chat soon
